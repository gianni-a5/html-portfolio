<h1>Best Movies of All Time According to Gianni</h1>

<h2>Here is a list of my top 5 favourite films, in not particular order...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>Beautifully artistic in every way. Funny, heart-warming, and with travel and adventure as one of the main themes.</p>

<h3>Yes Man</h3>
<p>Brings a message of saying yes to life, need I say more?</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Philosophical mind fuck.</p>

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Quirky, interesting film concept, brilliant execution.</p>

<h3>500 Days of Summer</h3>
<p>Guess it can be considered a rom com... Can it? Either way, it's not like the others. Cool concept, interesting use of time line, or maybe it's just Zoe Deschanel. Who knows.</p>
